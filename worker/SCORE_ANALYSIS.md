## Analysis

All proposals are scoring **11-13 percentage points above** the current 70% threshold:
- ✅ All scores are in the **low-to-mid 80s**
- ✅ Well above minimum threshold (70%)
- ✅ Indicates strong candidate quality

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep at 70%
- **Pros:** Allows more opportunities, especially for different strategies
- **Cons:** May include lower-quality candidates

### Option 2: Increase to 75%
- **Pros:** Filters out candidates below 75%, still allows these 80+ scores
- **Cons:** May reduce number of proposals

### Option 3: Increase to 80%
- **Pros:** Only very high-quality candidates (like these)
- **Cons:** May significantly reduce proposal count

### Option 4: Increase to 82%
- **Pros:** Matches the quality level of these invalidated proposals
- **Cons:** Very restrictive, may prevent other valid strategies from generating proposals

## Current Context

These proposals were invalidated due to a **bug** (spread width validation), not low scores. They all have:
- High scores (81-83%)
- Valid structure
- Proper debit ranges
- Good risk/reward characteristics

The 70% threshold seems appropriate for capturing a range of strategies, while these BEAR_PUT_DEBIT proposals naturally score higher.
